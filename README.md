Jar-Scan-Xnix
=============

This is a VERY SMALL utility which enables scanning jars on Xnix platforms (Unix/Linux) to find for classes/packages.

It can be used, forked and cloned freely.

The original author of this script is unknown.
The existing version of this script was modified by me for improved usability and is slightly different than the original.
